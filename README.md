# future-city-simulator
Future City Simulator is an educational web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates how population growth, energy sources, and transport systems influence a city’s environmental impact. It aims to promote awareness about sustainable development through interactive learning
Future City Simulator is an interactive web application that helps users explore how urban design decisions affect environmental sustainability. By adjusting parameters such as population, energy sources, and transportation systems, users can instantly see how their choices influence energy consumption, carbon emissions, and overall city health.

The project is designed to make complex ideas in urban planning and sustainability understandable through simple, visual simulation.

Why This Project?
Cities are responsible for the majority of global energy use and carbon emissions. However, most people do not get to see how everyday decisions scale up into large environmental impacts.
This project aims to bridge that gap by turning urban planning into an interactive learning experience.
Instead of reading about sustainability, users can experiment with it
